# PHTS NP-01: Volumio 3 backend

This is a modification of original [volumio3-backend] which is used by [PHTS NP-01].

Noticeable changes:

- New commands:
  - "Play next" (already implemented in original repo but keeping my own solution)
  - "Add to queue after current"
  - "Fast reboot" to restart only volumio service
- Add more data into player state to let UI and plugins show them:
  - Year
  - Track number (instead of physically insert it into track title)
  - Amount of queue items
- Display bitrate and sample rate correctly
- Fix and improve player action behavior:
  - Reset volume, repeat and random state on queue clear (e.g. playing other album) and after reboot
  - Fix previous/next buttons behavior
  - Support "go to artist/album" for Spotify Connect mode
- Improve UX of dev page
- Improve translations and toast message texts
- Improve stability, performance and fix a lot of bugs
- [...and more][commits]

## What is Volumio

Volumio is a Free and Open Source Linux Distribution, designed and fine-tuned exclusively for music playback. It runs on a variety of devices, typically small and cheap computers like the Raspberry PI, but also on low power PCs, notebooks or thin clients.

By flashing (installing) Volumio on any of this platforms, it will then become an headless Audiophile Music Player. Headless means that the only way to control it will be with another Mobile phone, computer or tablet.

This is made possible by Volumio’s UI: a web applications that runs on any device with a browser, and that allows an easy and intuitive control of your playback sessions. All communications between the webapp and Volumio will happen trough your home network.

## What's in this repo

- Manages running processes and daemons for audio playback
- Manages the system's vitals and configurations such as network, settings, lifecycle
